# 𝕏fy Anywhere

Let's 𝕏fy the location you love.


**You need to enable Map Tiles API & Geocoding API at https://console.cloud.google.com/. After that get & paste the Maps API key on the alert window.**

    The reason why the site asks you to enter your Google Maps API key is because individuals will quickly run out of quota for the Map Tiles API & Geocoding API.
There is no intention to collect them.

    If you don't want to paste your API key to my website, you can also fork this project and host on your own GitHub Pages and change `HOST_URL` to your one.
